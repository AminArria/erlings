Reverse
=====

In this opportunity we will play with lists and recursion.
Recursion can be tricky if you don't have a functional programming
background, for that reason take your time to read and really understand
that concept, a good place to start can be
[Wikipedia for theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)),
and [Learn some erlang](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/recursion) for
practical part.

This exercise consists in creating `reverse:r/1` which should be
[Tail Recurisve](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33923/what-is-tail-recursion),
and take a list as argument and return another list with every element
int the opposed position. For example if the input is `[1,2,3,4]` the
output should be `[4,3,2,1]`.

Check your solution running `make`, and see as a last resort or after
you finished this problem [our sample resolution](solution/reverse.erl).
