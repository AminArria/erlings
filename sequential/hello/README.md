Hello world
=====

This is the most iconic exercise in coding history, we should include
this one. Your only task is to create a function `hello:hello/0` that
returns the binary ``<<"hello world">>``. To test that is working
correctly check it running `make`.

For this exercise you may need to read about
[Erlang Modules](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/modules). And don't
worry yet about understanding binaries.

As a hint, the file you should be editing is `src/hello.erl`. But in any
case if the things get difficult you can check our
[proposal solution](solution/hello.erl).
