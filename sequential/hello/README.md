## Exercise

This is the most iconic exercise in coding history, we should include
this one. Your only task is to create a function `hello:hello/0` that
returns the binary ``<<"hello world">>`` (don't worry about understanding binaries, yet). To test that is working correctly check it running `make`.

As a hint, the file you should be editing is `src/hello.erl`. But in any
case if the things get difficult you can check our
[proposal solution](solution/hello.erl).
