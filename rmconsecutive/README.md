Remove consecutive
------------------

Create a function `rmconsecutive:rm/1` that takes a list and returns
another one but without any consecutive repetitions, for example if
the input is `[1,1,1,2,3,4,1,1,1,3]` the output should be `[1,2,3,4,1,3]`.

Check it's working with `make test`. You can compare your code with
