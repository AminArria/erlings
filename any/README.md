# Any

Write a function `any:list_any/2` that takes a predicate (a function that returns a boolean value) and a list and returns true if any element of the list satisfies the predicate and false otherwise.

Note: Implement it without using `lists:any`.

Run tests with ``make``.

As a hint, the file you should be editing is `src/any.erl`. But in any
case if the things get difficult you can check our [proposed solution](solution/any.erl).
